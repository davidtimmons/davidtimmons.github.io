## Summary

Creating a marketing strategy from thin air involves hours or days of
intense thinking. Successful marketers know they must approach this
process with care, but it is not always clear where to begin.

Some strategy approaches amount to throwing a handful of tactics in
front of random passersby in hope of generating interest. Then, the
marketer discretely peers out from his or her hiding spot to watch who
takes the bait. Probability laws indicate this approach will be
successful now and then (it just may take a billion tries.)

However, unless your organization has stacks of money earmarked for your
marketing budget, hidden in secret vaults buried beneath the foundation
of your offices, **a much more efficient approach is to build your
marketing strategy on top of a framework**. That is the gist of what I
present here.

You will learn about a marketing strategy [mental model][3], how digital
marketing fits within this framework, and see the different information
flows impacting your organization. These suggestions are applicable to
all marketing areas, including B2C and B2B.

**Got your coffee? Ready to get started?**

## Introduction

*Why you should read this.*

Misconceptions occasionally surround the concept of marketing. The
American Marketing Association ([AMA][]) has an ["official" definition][4]
it adopts, yet I would simply say marketing facilitates the exchange of
value between your organization and your customers.

It is not a sales function, per se, though very often it directly leads
into your sales process. Instead, **trust is the cornerstone of good
marketing**. This trust between you and your audience can build to a
fiscal outcome. However, trust is hard fought and easily lost. And where
people are involved things can get tricky:

> *We're entering an era of reciprocity. We now have to engage people in
> a way that's useful or helpful to their lives. The consumer is looking
> to satisfy their needs, and we have to be there to help them with
> that. To put it another way: How can we exchange value instead of just
> sending a message?*

**[Kim Kadlec][] » Johnson & Johnson, Worldwide VP, Global Marketing Group**

This quote from Ms. Kadlec originates within Google's
*[Winning the Zero Moment of Truth (ZMOT)][5]* ebook by Jim Lecinski.
Anybody interested in marketing should read it. It outlines a marketing
strategy mental model first developed by Proctor & Gamble then later
modified by Google to reflect modern consumer habits. Digital marketing
strategies should first be held against this model to determine
potential effectiveness. Understanding what this model implies for you
forms a basis for the discussion below.

## Marketing Strategy Mental Model

*Understanding a framework from Google and Proctor & Gamble.*

Modern B2C and B2B **consumers have largely decided whether or not to
purchase your product** (or email your salesperson, visit your store,
donate to your nonprofit, and so on) **before ever engaging with you**
Further, it has also been shown that entire businesses are beginning
to approach the requisition process with a consumer mindset.

Take a moment and consider that.

As marketers we must engage with every consumer in a meaningful and
authentic way *before* ever knowing a name. And to do that, we must be
present in those channels where our target audience resides:

> *...the average shopper used 10.4 sources of information to make a
> decision in 2011...\[These\] range from TV commercials and magazine
> articles, to recommendations from friends and family, to websites,
> ratings, and blogs online.*

**Google/Shopper Sciences » [Zero Moment of Truth Macro Study, U.S.][6],
April 2011**

10.4 sources of information seem extreme until you consider the first
results page of an online search often includes 10 or more possible
choices. And this is only one step in the mental journey from need
realization to purchase! Google's 'Zero Moment of Truth' (ZMOT) mental
model takes this into account and provides an excellent framework for
developing your marketing strategy:

![Google ZMOT Equation][7]

ZMOT describes the consumer journey with four discrete steps.

**Stimulus.** This is the trigger causing your target audience to
realize an unmet need. The trigger could include stimuli such as
Facebook advertising, online reviews, direct mail, news articles,
brochures, or anything else that flips the mental switch. At this stage
your brand must present something compelling enough to cut through the
noise.

**Zero Moment of Truth.** This is everything the consumer will do
leading up to an imminent purchase decision. Here, the journey could
include talking with friends, social media interaction, online search,
brand website visits, reading online reviews, reading brand email,
watching videos, or utilizing other resources that provide information
or entertainment value. The consumer is asking, "Will your product save
me money? Will it save me time? Will it improve my life?"

**First Moment of Truth.** This step comes just before the consumer
transacts with your brand. He or she might be standing in your store,
talking with your salesperson, looking at your displays, adding items to
an ecommerce shopping cart, signing up for your service, or doing any
other pre-transaction activities. Now the consumer is asking, "Have you
answered my questions to my satisfaction? Am I sure I want to do this?
Can I see myself in a relationship with your brand?"

**Second Moment of Truth.** Finally, the consumer purchases your product
and reflects on the entire experience. Is he or she satisfied?
Disappointed? Will your customer purchase from you again? Many people
will readily express these sentiments, influencing other people at the
Zero Moment of Truth. For example, your customer might voice these
opinions in a social media community or an online review.

You must ask yourself if your marketing strategy covers all these steps.
The traditional model of **push marketing and blanket advertising is
*no longer wholly sufficient***. They are one possible element of an
overall plan. To maximize success your brand must be very accessible,
very compelling, and very authentic. As Mr. Lecinski points out:

> *If consumers will do research online for houses and health care,
> they'll also do it for Band-Aids and ballpoint pens.*

**[Jim Lecinski][] » Google, VP of U.S. Sales & Service**

Now we have a very solid framework for understanding marketing strategy
and can begin to add specific marketing programs into this mental model.

## Integrated Marketing Strategy

*Fitting digital marketing programs into the ZMOT model.*

The diagram below shows how your target audience might take the ZMOT
journey. It could involve activities like searching your company forum
or reading an online review of your brand. **This diagram is highly
simplified and varies by consumer, but it serves as a starting point for
layering in your marketing programs**.

We should also mention business experts have written libraries of best
practice material for each subject area presented in the diagram. It is
beyond the scope of this discussion to bridge into that material, but
the Internet has a wealth of resources.

Here is one example of how your ZMOT marketing ecosystem might look:

![Marketing Strategy Ecosystem][8]

We see here all the elements of the ZMOT model: Stimulus, Zero Moment of
Truth, First Moment of Truth, and Second Moment of Truth.

After the initial stimulus, a consumer spends time researching your
brand. He or she decides to initiate your sales process (i.e. enters
your location, talks with your salesperson, submits an [RFP][],
uses your ecommerce shopping cart, and so on) and becomes your customer.
Your new customer reflects on his or her accumulated experiences. Then,
wanting to share those experiences, your customer creates content that
goes back into the ZMOT cycle influencing the next consumer who takes
the journey.

What you just read is a **perpetual process**:

> *This is the new digital shelf. Consumers arrive there, 24 hours a
> day, ready to engage. They're anybody's to win or lose. The
> opportunity is incredible; are you ready for it?*

**[Jim Lecinski][] » Google, VP of U.S. Sales & Service**

Now we have both a suitable marketing strategy mental model and an idea
how to layer in marketing programs. You might take comfort in knowing
few experts get everything right on the first pass. This is why
continually optimizing your strategy is crucial to achieving positive
results.

## Optimizing Your Marketing Strategy

*How information sources feed into marketing strategy optimization.*

A marketing strategy is like an engine: there are numerous moving parts
that require periodic maintenance in order to propel the entire
framework forward. **Optimizing your marketing strategy *is* that
necessary maintenance**.

When you set your marketing plan in motion, it generates data. When your
competition sets their plans in motion, it generates more data.
Additionally, the processes internal to your organization generate data.
Each source can be analyzed in turn and combined into a valuable
reference for directing your operation.

This is how that information flow appears:

![Marketing Strategy Information Flow][9]

Having processes in place to convert raw facts and numbers into business
intelligence (known as BI) and competitive intelligence (known as CI) is
critical. Operating without this information amounts to guessing your
way to the right answer. Sometimes you will be correct, but far more
often, you will not.

An example of how business intelligence might play out is with social
media. Let us say you want to create a social media community in order
to enjoin brand advocacy. Part of the community building process
includes listening to what people are saying about you and your industry
in order to know what kind of content will be valuable to your target
audience. Business intelligence captures that data and converts it into
a content recommendation for your community manager.

An example of how competitive intelligence might factor into your
marketing strategy is with domain registration. When an organization
registers a new website URL, it creates a record. Tracking these
registrations could inform you that a competitor will soon launch a new
service that directly competes with one of yours. If you have this
information ahead of time, you can immediately increase your marketing
budget allocation around *your* service to downplay the launch of the
competing service. In this way you retain your [share of voice][].
Competitive intelligence brings together many different data points to
give you an edge.

As with the marketing programs discussion, business intelligence and
competitive intelligence are deep topics. The work requires a
combination of tenacious logic and the correct tools, as well as time to
distill this information into a usable format.

Now, at this point we are equipped with a ZMOT marketing strategy mental
model, an idea how to layer in marketing programs, and a broad
understanding of the strategic information flow impacting your marketing
programs. These concepts are the foundation that will help you compose a
comprehensive marketing strategy for your organization.

## Wrapping Up

*Although this story has an ending, yours is just beginning!*

Here we are at the end. You made it! Have you finished your coffee?

You just read about the 'Zero Moment of Truth' (ZMOT) marketing strategy
mental model developed by Google and Proctor & Gamble. You read how
digital marketing services fit within this model. And finally, you read
how data from both your organization and your competitors' organizations
can be harnessed into an effective marketing strategy.

This is a lot of ground to cover. As discussed earlier, there are
libraries written on each one of these subjects, and the material
presented here should be viewed as a starting point. I hope you found
this discussion helpful! Now, in the words of Seth Godin, "Go make
something happen."
