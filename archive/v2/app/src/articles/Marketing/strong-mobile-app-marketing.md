    "A brand that builds a custom mobile app can create a great mechanism for
    acquiring engaged users that contribute to ROI. But unless that brand
    also takes a serious approach to mobile app marketing, very few people
    will ever see that app."

It's no secret that modern marketing needs to incorporate mobile devices
into the campaign mix. Creating a custom mobile app affords a great
opportunity to extend your brand's reach. And while you may already know
this will require extra attention within your marketing plan, you should
also consider how you will optimize the components of mobile app
marketing unique to your app.

Mobile research company Yankee Group predicts as many as 1.3 billion
mobile app *users* worldwide in 2013. Gartner Research
[predicts 81.4 billion mobile app *downloads* in 2013][3]. The market
is there, yet the quality of your mobile app marketing will determine
your ultimate success.

Here's why: [775,000][4].

That's how many apps you compete against when you release a mobile app
into the Apple App Store. Visibility is key, and one important mobile
app marketing component to help you get in front of your desired
audience is App Store Optimization (ASO), cousin to Search Engine
Optimization (SEO).

The premise of ASO is to build your mobile app title and descriptions
around carefully selected keywords. When a user searches for one of your
keywords, you want your app to appear high in the search results.

Look at your competitors. How do they describe themselves? Can you do a
better job? Use some of their keywords and craft a good title, features
list, and mobile app description for your own software.

Are your competitors' mobile app marketing efforts completely optimized?
Do they have countless app downloads and positive reviews? Spend some
time to find alternate ASO keywords and capture "long tail" users who
search by less common phrases.

Social media is also important in mobile app marketing. You will find
many different variations of social media integration within modern app
design. Find a compelling way to integrate this functionality into your
own mobile app in a way that makes sense for your brand. Every user that
shares an app update to his or her social network acts as an amplifier
for your brand awareness.

Another visibility component is number of downloads. Mobile app store
search algorithms utilize this as part of how they rank your app. Apps
that receive a large number downloads within a short timeframe are
typically given special attention.

Some companies accept payment in exchange for downloading your app
numerous times. However, think carefully before pursuing this
questionable mobile app marketing approach. Apple and others sometimes
penalize publishers who go this route. Furthermore, these downloads will
not *directly* lead to sales or engaged users.

Consider instead supporting your app with a well-planned mobile app
marketing campaign. This approach has a better chance of landing you
quality users who will contribute to your ROI.

Have you developed a mobile app for your brand, or have you thought
about doing so? What promotion techniques would you use?
