Did you ever wonder why so many stores use coupons or why a company will
give shoes to a developing nation for every pair you purchase? These are
different marketing incentives intended to motivate us into buying more
stuff.

Here's another example for you. You know that aluminum ultrabook you
just purchased? The one that made all your friends jealous? The
manufacturer is aware of that. Your shiny, new computer exemplifies
another marketing incentive.

Economists and social scientists each have a different bent when it
comes to incentives. We marketers are no different. Our toolkit holds
*economic*, *moral*, and *personal* levers we can use to nudge human
behavior toward a desired action.

A good marketing campaign makes full use of incentive levers. But it's
important to remember that people are clever. We can all choose whether
to be incentivized, and part of that decision is how much trust the
marketer has earned.

We know why you gave us a punch card for a free sundae. You want us to
buy more sundaes! Should we like you and trust you, we'll probably even
go along with it. We might even tell other people!

As marketers we must understand how these tools work in order to
effectively use them in our own marketing efforts. It's not about
"tricking" your customers. It's about making it easier for them to act.
Here's how:

**Economic incentives**. These marketing incentives materially reward
(or punish) your audience. Coupons are a clear example, but the reward
doesn't have to be money. It could be cupcakes!

**Moral incentives**. These marketing incentives harness what your
audience feels is the right (or the wrong) thing to do. The community
admires a moral goal. But should someone work against those things the
community deems admirable, that person can expect sideways glances and
hushed whispers as he or she walks down the street. This is why you buy
fundraiser chocolate bars from your coworker's kids - to feel good. And
to avoid icy silence. No one likes to be shunned.

**Personal incentives**. These marketing incentives work with the
individual motivations that drive each of us. Emotions, personal tastes,
and desires rule the day here. You might take your picture next to an
Italian sports car because, to some people, owning one is like a neon
sign that exclaims, "I'm a pretty cool guy. You should pay attention to
me."

At this point you may be thinking that correctly using marketing
incentives is a challenge. That's right! Human behavior is complex.
Here's a fun capstone video with all our concepts and all our complex
human behavior nicely illustrated.

Marketing seeks to impact human behavior, therefore incentives govern
marketing. Finding the right levers for your brand should always be a
core part of your marketing strategy.
