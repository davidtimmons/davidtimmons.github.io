"[Gamification][]" has been around a few years, and most marketers have at
least *thought* about ways to incorporate this concept into their campaigns.

It's an interesting premise: Gamification employs psychology to reward
specific tasks that serve your business objective. Often we see this
used to boost social media community participation.

For example, [Foursquare][] is a social channel devised entirely from
gamification principles. Participants compete with friends, score points,
and earn status based on usage. The ones who "win" are the ones who use
Foursquare most.

But what if you could use these same gamification principles not just to
drive marketing impressions but, instead, to improve efficiency within
your organization?

## Context through gamification

How you frame a situation determines attitude toward that situation.
Gamification shifts that framing. Imagine this scenario:

**Several work requests sit in your inbox.**

> You hate it when these pile up. There are three different people from
> three different departments who *all* want your input on their
> projects. Don't they know you're busy working on a customer request?
> Maybe there's time to respond to these new emails, maybe not. But
> everyone can just *wait* until you get to it.

With thoughtful gamification elements in place, this could be the *new*
narrative:

> You *love* seeing work requests land in your inbox. If you turn them
> out quickly enough, you'll take the office high score away from
> Johnson and may even win one of those European candy bars as a reward
> for first place. You're busy working on a customer request -- and
> that's important -- but you're just *itching* to knock out these three
> new emails, wipe that smile off Johnson's face, and walk away eating
> fancy chocolate.

## Press start to play

*[Gamification Wiki][3]* is an informational treasure trove useful for
planning a gamification effort. Start there. Learn the principles, learn
the building blocks.

Most people would rather play a game than do work. So how much more
productive would your organization be if the entire work day felt more
like a game? Plenty.

Have you used gamification to shift internal processes at your
organization?
