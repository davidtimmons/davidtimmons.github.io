Do your coworkers hide when they see you coming?

Good project management must efficiently handle constraints. If you
manage resources of any kind, you know time and budgets are always
finite quantities. However, when your project management philosophy
neglects this reality, you'll find yourself causing undue stress to your
team and your stakeholders.

The "[Project Management Triangle][3]" is a model of constraints.
*Time*, *Scope*, and *Cost* represent the three points of this triangle,
and the job of a project management professional is to align a project
against this triangle according to the project's business objectives.
This isn't always easy.

Have you heard the scenario that says a project can be characterized as
*Fast*, *Good*, or *Cheap* but you can only pick two options? This is
the very definition of constrained resources. By choosing your two
options, the third quality will suffer.

For example, if you request a content-heavy, standards-compliant website
using bleeding-edge design practices and you want it done in a week, the
cost will be enormous! A complex project requires a large number of
moving parts. Speeding up the processes involved results in either
significant employee overtime or additional resources needed to complete
the extra work.

This is why it's so important that all stakeholders involved in a
project understand the *Project Management Triangle* tradeoff. But even
the most experienced project management professionals will have trouble
keeping a project on the rails when reality flies out the window.

Miscommunication between the stakeholders defining a project and the
people responsible for doing the actual work can result in disaster.
Good communication is always key when defining business objectives. If
you think it only takes 2 hours to do a certain task and your programmer
is telling you it will take 8 hours, listen! He or she is telling you
there is a time constraint hidden within your scoping assumption.

Take time to understand the *Time*, *Scope*, and *Cost* tradeoff
specific to your projects. Stakeholders and project management
professionals should be working within known, realistic constraints.

When you plan your project according to the triangle, coworkers should
no longer hide when they see you coming. They will welcome the project
management process as an efficient way to achieve success.

How do you manage constraints in your projects?
