Information floods every corner of our modern Internet. We're all in a
hurry, and interpreting the tidal wave before us requires snap judgments
to process information quickly.

*Yahoo! News* commenters frequently admit to only skimming articles
before reading the attached comments. This reading approach signals
whether the information presented in the article is worthy of further
consideration without expending significant mental effort. Pages of
strongly-worded comments imply the information is important.

But is this actually the case?

Do comments associated with news articles, social media, and online
reviews accurately indicate information worth? Not always, according to
a study published in the *[Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication][3]*.

## Online comments are a mental shortcut

In an [interview with *NPR*][4], communication researchers say people use
mental shortcuts to process information. We need an anchor to make sense
of what we read. Comments serve as that anchor point.

The study shows "rudeness and incivility is used as a mental shortcut to
make sense of those complicated issues." Negative comments are very
polarizing, leading to a strong opinion on a topic. Neutral and positive
comments don't often cause the reader to change an opinion.

Our mental flow works like this:

1.  We process certain information based on the content of online comments.
2.  We think an issue is important when online comments have a strong, negative tone.
3.  Our time-starved reality inhibits our ability to form a unique opinion of our own.
4.  Therefore, we sway in favor of the strongest voices in order to save mental energy.
5.  This leads to cognitive bias wherein our judgement becomes illogical.

## Create a new anchor

Shady politicians and unscrupulous businesses have long understood this
process. A common, highly unethical practice is to flood a competing
political or business opponent with negative online comments in order to
create an opportunity for "a better alternative".

For these reasons organizations such as the *Word of Mouth Marketing Association*
recommend you have a comment policy on websites you maintain. Control the
message, control perception.

Appropriate participation on websites you don't control is equally
important. While fans of your brand may defend your reputation, don't
depend on it. Monitor your brand sentiment within the Internet
wilderness and join the conversation to provide a counterpoint when
needed.

While you cannot always predict which anchor a reader will use to
interpret your message, you can improve your odds through active
moderating and participation.

Does negative commentary impact your opinions?
