The signal-to-noise ratio in social media marketing can be described as
a comparison of value versus junk. Becoming relevant takes work. Your
content, its context, and your conversation methods must all be in sync.

Begin tuning your social media marketing by following the timeless
advice of [Strunk & White][3]: **omit needless words!**

Everything you communicate must strengthen your core idea.
