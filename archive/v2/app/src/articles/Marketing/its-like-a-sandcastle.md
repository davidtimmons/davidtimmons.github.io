A system is a set of related ideas that works together. Systems produce
marketing. Efficient marketing systems can produce good results, but it
isn't always obvious why our systems succeed.

"Small details" are a common theme in modern content marketing. Examples
from this theme often describe the finer points of specific marketing
tactics.

Small details and fine points are all well and good, but what can we do
with all this minutiae?

It's like a sandcastle. Tiny grains of sand have limited value when
considered individually. However, when shaped into turrets and carved
into walls, magnificent sandcastles emerge from the realm of ideas into
reality. In the same way, marketing details can be gathered, stacked,
and shaped into structures that support your promotional endeavors.

Let's use Twitter as an example. Business professionals everywhere can
build Twitter marketing systems from these components:

-   Avatar
-   Background image
-   Header image
-   Username
-   Profile
-   Content plan
-   Campaign software
-   Tweets

Once combined, the decisions you made when shaping each component will
define your user experience. Your success depends on making good
decisions at each juncture. And much like a sandcastle, we can change
these decisions and modify the system by adjusting our "small details".
This is how you optimize your marketing.

It's much harder to pinpoint why your marketing is successful without
understanding how your internal and external systems interact. But once
we understand "the why", we can then duplicate our success and mitigate
failure with far greater ease.

Intimate understanding of what we do and why we do it is a very
pragmatic course of action toward building long-term results for your
organization.
