Marketing was once easy. In fact, it was often synonymous with
advertising. You hired an artist to depict happy people using your
product, wrote an accompanying paragraph or two extolling the virtues of
life with your brand, and you ran that piece in major magazines or on
your favorite television network. Very straightforward.

Today, marketing is not so easy. While advertising remains one method of
generating sales leads, the tactics required to place your brand in
front of the people who will purchase it have ballooned exponentially:

-   Websites.
-   Social media.
-   Mobile devices.
-   Email.
-   Search engine rankings.
-   Co-creation.
-   Crowdsourcing.
-   Events.
-   *And* advertising.

Like a tree, marketing continues to sprout new branches despite what its
gardener may prefer. The knowledge capital required to run an effective
marketing department can be *staggering*, and passive advertising no
longer cuts it.

Our profession matured into a level of complexity unique to our age, and
this maturity demands a breadth of skillsets to tend it. You can either
hire an army of specialists or hire several generalists.

Which person should your marketing department prefer? Here's a hint: the
*[Harvard Business Review][3]* thinks you should hire generalists.

## Effective Hiring

Articles like those featured in *[HBR][3]* and *[GeekWire][4]* describe
the benefits a "generalist" -- also known as "full-stack" -- marketer
can bring to an organization. For example, *sophistication*.

A sophisticated marketing campaign incorporates different ideas in a
unified voice. Your marketing becomes unified when individuals on your
staff can do some of everything, eliminating the disharmony that comes
from too many opinions embedded into your creative process.

Generalists pool internal knowledge from different areas to achieve a
**sophisticated result**.

Specialists team with other specialists to achieve a **result**. These
dissenting voices often produce an unmemorable outcome. At worst, it's
confusing.

## Generalist Strengths

Relying on marketing specialists instead of marketing generalists is
ultimately a shortsighted solution.

A smart generalist can absorb new information and reach competency very
quickly. This competency may only net you 80% mastery of a particular
marketing subject, but 99% of the time, near-mastery is all you need.
When the situation requires 100% depth in a particular marketing topic,
you are likely pursuing either a **fringe case** or an **overkill
solution**.

Then you move on to the *next* campaign.

This new campaign may look different than the one you just finished.
Your generalist can switch gears and speed up. Your specialist pulls
over to wait for another expertise-matching scenario, and that's
unproductive.

## For the win

Modern marketing is complex. The required knowledge comes from many
different areas, and that knowledge must have a variety of technical and
artistic skills to support it.

So in our modern age, hire the generalists for your marketing
department, and hire based on capacity to learn *more* rather than "5
years doing *the same XYZ*". This is how you future proof your
lead-generating machine, and that grows your bottom line.

What do you think -- generalists or specialists for your marketing
department?
