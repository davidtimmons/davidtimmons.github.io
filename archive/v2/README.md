====================
_**Author:** David Timmons ([http://david.timmons.io](http://david.timmons.io "Visit my website!"))_

This is my personal website. It uses the static site generator _Metalsmith_ to convert _Markdown_
files and _Handlebars_ templates into published content. Utility tools include _Python_ and
_Bash_ webscrapers that pull content from the previous _WordPress_ site and convert it into the
new format.

## Features

* Blog articles.
* Project demos.
* Project descriptions.

## Dependencies (Development Only)

* [Metalsmith:](http://www.metalsmith.io "Visit the Metalsmith website.") Generates static content.
* [Handlebars:](http://handlebarsjs.com "Visit the Handlebars website.") Supports HTML templates.

## Production

See the live website [**here**](http://david.timmons.io "Visit my website!")!

## Note to Self

Files for the published website are located in the `docs` directory. Execute the command
`npm run release` to build these files and move them appropriately.
