What media comes to mind when you think about advertising? Many people
think of television commercials. There are also plenty of billboards
spread along roadways, and you'll hear radio spots during your commute.
Some businesses showcase their ads in newspapers. Other ads come in the
form of weekly retail circulars.

What do all these have in common? **Ads are only effective as part of an
overall marketing plan!**

When promoting your business, it's important to remember that the
function of advertising is to generate awareness and, ideally, to create
a perceived need among your prospective customers. There are many
frameworks you could adapt when planning your ads. The one I prefer is
[Google's ZMOT model][3], originally developed by Procter & Gamble. For
more information see the ["Marketing Strategy"][4] page on our website.

Under ZMOT, advertising is part of the "stimulus" for action. If your
ads fail, you've wasted your money. But should you succeed, your
potential customers will then seek to learn more information about what
you are offering.

It's at that stage when you want to have glowing reviews, a sensible
website, an interesting social media presence, and other inbound
marketing tools that build gravitas around your brand. Your potential
customers are quickly forming opinions about you *before* they ever talk
with you. You had better make sure these opinions are formed in your
favor!

When hiring someone to create your advertising, consider this:

-   Sometimes the lowest bidder creates the worst brand impression.
-   Bad writing and bad acting *reflect on your brand.*
-   Nobody wants to see your children or your family in your advertising
    unless you are *specifically selling* a child or family-oriented
    service. But even then, proceed with caution.
-   Adopt healthy skepticism toward anyone who tells you that
    advertising is all you need to effectively promote your brand.

What other advise would you give to organizations promoting themselves
with modern media tactics?
