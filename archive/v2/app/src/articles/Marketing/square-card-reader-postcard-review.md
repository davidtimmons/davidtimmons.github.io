Square sent me a postcard soon after registering Tachmorn Marketing, LLC
with the Texas Secretary of State. I'm sure they also do this with other
businesses. You may even know someone who uses a Square card reader, but
at the very least, you've probably heard about the technology.

The Square card reader plugs directly into your smart phone. You swipe a
customer's credit card through the device and pay a transaction fee to
collect instant payment for your product or service. I'm sure it works
great for mobile professionals like indie rock bands. Or food truck
operators. I've even seen some interesting applications at
brick-and-mortar locations.

The thing is, while I love technology, my business does not have a need
the Square card reader will address. So for my business, this postcard
represents wasted money. You have to research and segment your mailing
lists to reach the right people, and that takes time. Mass marketing
does not always work for this very reason.

However, for the right audience, the Square card reader postcard
actually is a nice piece of marketing.

## Marketing Critique

*Because there is always more to learn!*

**Audience**
-   Small business
-   Mobile business

**Audience Worldview**
-   "I don't want a complex or custom solution. Just give me something I
    can turn on and use."

**Marketing Story**
-   "It's easy and cheap to accept credit cards in person."

**Incentives**
-   **Economic:** The reader is free. It saves me time which saves me
    money.
-   **Moral:** N/A
-   **Personal:** Peace of Mind (no commitment needed, no complicated
    software to learn)

**Call to Action**
-   Get your free card reader at [squareup.com/free][2]

**Design**
-   It's clean and uncluttered which will lead to increased readership.
-   I have a clear understanding of the product.
-   I know what they want me to do next.

**Pros**
-   Simple design is useful in situations where attention spans are
    short. Mass mailings qualify!
-   The marketing message is consistent.
-   The call to action is clear and strong.

**Cons**
-   I am not the target audience, which means if I were a normal person
    I would have immediately chucked this postcard. But I didn't!
    Marketers are weird.

So what's the lesson here? **Know your audience**.

How would you critique this Square card reader postcard?
