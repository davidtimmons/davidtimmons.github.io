Virtual reality technology has come a long way in 20 years. Early
advancements like Nintendo's 1995 *[Virtual Boy][3]* and Google's
2007 *[Street View][4]* gave us glimpses into how this technology
might advance. Now, in 2016, Facebook's Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive,
produced from a joint partnership between hand-held device manufacturer
HTC and video game titan Valve Corporation, are the two leading virtual
reality headsets currently in market. Sony will release its PlayStation
VR later this year. Many other companies, including Samsung and Google,
continue to develop solutions that can transform mobile devices into
makeshift VR headsets. This current wave of virtual reality devices is
so advanced and so immersive that we stand on the edge of major
technological and social tectonic shifts that will forever change the
way we define our reality. Take note! Virtual reality is the dawn of the
Internet, the rise of Web 2.0, and the advent of the smart phone all over
again. While we may not see widespread adoption for several years, it will
happen. So how can a technology-savvy business prepare?

Modify your design approach when creating content for three-dimensional
space. The human body limits the experiences you can design. We are
highly visual creatures adept at motion tracking and spatial
orientation, so when we receive conflicting visual and spatial cues, our
biology often responds with nausea. Have you ever been car sick? It's
the same principle. Visually and spatially you are hurtling down the
highway, yet at the same time, you are stationary inside the car.
Virtual reality experiences must be programmed in a way that tracks head
movement exceptionally well. Any other physical motion mapped to a
virtual space must also take care to avoid triggering our biology into a
bout of severe nausea.

Learn or be prepared to hire three-dimensional art and panoramic
photography skills. There are multiple devices available through which
to express a virtual environment, but no matter what "canvas" you
choose, you will need serious computer modeling and animation skills or
specialized equipment that can capture 360 degree images and footage.
Because virtual reality is inherently a 3D visual medium, the required
production skills will be very similar to those needed for creating a
movie or a video game. Forward-thinking enterprises should begin
sourcing these skills now before demand jumps.

Incorporate virtual reality as another "device" in your online content's
responsive design. Web developers have long adopted responsive design
principles when building production-ready websites and applications.
It's quite common to visit a website and experience it differently
depending on how you arrived. Responsive websites already present online
content in the manner best suited for a particular viewing experience
(e.g. small mobile screens versus big-screen TVs), so it's no stretch to
include virtual reality devices as part of that lineup. There may come a
time when users commonly surf the Web using tools like *[JanusVR][]*
expecting an immersive virtual experience different from viewing the same
content on a home computer monitor. A business that anticipates and
accommodates this trend today will have first-mover advantage.

Virtual reality has finally arrived. You can create a virtual experience
built as a software application native to a targeted VR headset; you can
build a virtual environment intended for a mobile device; or you can
even create a Web-based virtual experience using tools like Mozilla's
*[A-Frame][]* framework. However, while each platform
is different, they all enable virtual reality using the same general
principles. This technology is now sufficiently advanced to take notice.
Nabisco's Oreo brand, the New York Times, and Cochella Music Festival
are just a few organizations exploring possibilities in virtual space,
and there will be many more as consumer VR adoption moves from the
"early adopter" phase into "early and late majority". Technology-savvy
companies who prepare now are the ones who stand to gain the most when
the tsunami hits.
