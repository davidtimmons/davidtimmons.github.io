Your customer buys an experience, not your widgets. What are you
selling? This is an important distinction because it can determine how
successful your marketing activities will be.

Let's build a hypothetical example around a company whose "widget" is
outsourced IT networking services. We'll call this company "Initrode"
(since "Initech" [burned down in a mysterious fire][3]).

Initrode customers want to feel secure. They *don't* want a router and
100 feet of CAT5E cable. So how do you market a router and 100 feet of
CAT5E cable when potential customers may not understand what these
things are?

The following example describes one way to build an inbound marketing
approach for Initrode. Use it as a template to generate ideas for *your
own* marketing endeavors.

## The Setup

**Product or Service:**
-   Outsourced IT networking services

**Marketing Goal:**
-   Generate inbound inquiries via phone calls or email.

## Q&A with Initrode

**Strategy Framework:**
-   What do you stand for?
-   Who is your competition?
-   What is your competition doing?
-   How are you different?

**Initrode:** "We're the best IT networking specialists in the city and
have the certifications to prove it. There are other guys out there who
do IT networking, but they don't have access to the variety of skills we
have in *our* company. Initrode is the most expert. But the other guys
are cheaper."

**Audience:**
-   Who buys your service?
-   Who uses your service?
-   How big are your customers?
-   How technical are your customers?

**Initrode:** "We normally deal with office managers at companies that
don't have an IT department. Some Initrode clients are IT geniuses who
call us because they have no time to spare on networking issues. Most
just aren't technically oriented."

**Marketing Structure:**
-   How do customers hear about you?
-   What is your marketing approach?
-   What is your purchasing process?
-   What tools do you give your customers to talk about you?
-   Do you delight your customers?

**Initrode:** "Some customers hear about us through advertising. We
haven't done much else. Our marketing approach was to build a website,
but we know there is much more that can be done to generate interest in
our service. After a customer agrees to do business with us, we gather
facts, visit the property, and build an estimate. Then we go to work. We
probably delight our customers, but it's hard to say."

## Marketing Analysis

*Points to consider.*

First, Initrode is going to need a good marketing story. Its audience
doesn't care about the technology. It cares about ease-of-use and
security.

Initrode's deep expertise is its core differentiation only if Initrode
frames it in a way that matches the audience worldview. For example, one
potential story could be, "We get in and get out with a minimum of
hassle because we're highly trained."

Initrode should monitor its competition. Its competitors may work at a
lower cost, but is there a reason? Perhaps competing service providers
work at lower rates but require a long-term maintenance contract. Or
perhaps the low rates are only a temporary promotion meant to steal
customers and corner the market. A proactive approach is often better
than a reactive approach.

A feedback loop would be very beneficial here. Customers are going to
have an opinion anyway, so why not make it easy to share? This will
either boost referrals or provide an opportunity to address
frustrations. Initrode wins either way.

Is there a measurement system in place for current marketing activity?
If so, is anyone looking at the data? Initrode should study activity in
its marketing programs leading up to the conversion goals. This is the
only efficient way to optimize marketing activity for better results.

It's also important to remember that inbound marketing is just as much
about building gravity around a brand as it is about generating
conversions. Brand gravity increases the velocity of goal conversions.

## Inbound Marketing System

*Actions to consider.*
-   Define success criteria for every marketing activity.
-   Measure results of all marketing activity.
-   Monitor competition for activity and promotions.
-   Create a unifying story for all marketing activity.
-   Optimize website for email and call conversion.
-   Optimize website for search engine ranking.
-   Create landing page specific to the target audience segments.
-   Create an online keyword advertising campaign to drive traffic to
    the landing pages.
-   Optimize landing pages with A/B testing.
-   Create a Twitter customer support channel for those customers who
    *are* technically oriented.
-   Create a referral program to encourage word of mouth.

What else would you suggest for our hypothetical IT services company?
