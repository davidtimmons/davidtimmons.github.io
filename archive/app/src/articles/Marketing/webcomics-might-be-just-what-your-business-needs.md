Judicious use of creativity can set your business apart from others in
your industry. While tolerance for unusual ideas may vary by company,
there is always room for doing something unique. [Webcomics][] are one
example you may be able to use to promote your organization.

Do you remember the NBC television series *Heroes* from 2006? NBC
utilized a variety of promotional devices to generate buzz for its show.
Every week artists released a new issue in a series of webcomics that
provided character information and plot details not seen in the episodes.
[These *Heroes* webcomics][3] were popular enough in their own right that
NBC eventually compiled and sold them in printed form for extra
merchandising revenue.

Even in more corporate settings you can find use of comics and webcomics
in marketing. Zappos designed its [employee handbook][4] to resemble a
comic book so that its employees would actually enjoy reading company
policies. As a result, Zappos received tremendous attention from bloggers
and news outlets all commenting on this unusual tactic. An internal
creative decision to keep employees happy turned out to be a method that
generated buzz for the business.

Successful marketing is all about a "test-and-measure" approach. Over
the last two weeks I posted two experimental webcomics in the
[Tachmorn Marketing Facebook community][5]. These strips are called
"Agency Life" and contain scenarios that often arise when working in
a marketing agency.

My goal was to create entertaining content for the Facebook community in
order to generate further engagement. This is what we posted:

![Agency Life: "Client Delivery" (1 of 2)][6]

![Agency Life: "Project Estimate" (2 of 2)][7]

Producing webcomics requires a dedicated creative resource. You must
plan a setting that complements your organization, design characters
that will drive your stories, and write interesting plots or punchlines
that weave all the components together into a compelling experience.
Creating webcomics can easily become a full-time position in its own
right.

But the overall point behind this webcomics discussion is this: adopting
unique ideas into your marketing plan is always a step in the right
direction. While your ideas may or may not turn out as you expected,
building a reputation for innovation has its own benefit to your bottom
line.

What creative marketing ideas have you tried at your organization?
