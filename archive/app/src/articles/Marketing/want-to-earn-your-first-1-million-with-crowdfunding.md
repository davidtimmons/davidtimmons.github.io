[Crowdfunding][] is a way to bypass the sometimes onerous process of
raising capital. Using this approach entrepreneurs can request monetary
support from the communities they wish to benefit, often in exchange
for exclusive incentives. But this approach is only as effective as the
marketing strategy behind it.

For years, entrepreneurs had to rely on bank loans and venture capital
to raise the money necessary to fund a new idea. However, our consumer
culture has shifted to one of mass participation, and that opens the
door to this new method of financing.

[OUYA][] is an example of successful crowdfunding. In *[just over 8 hours][3]*,
this video game console raised $1 million. After only a month, it raised
*[over $8.5 million][4]*. No strings attached!

Not every crowdfunding project is this successful. But OUYA demonstrates
the magnitude of what is possible when an entrepreneur delivers what the
market wants in a way the market can identify.

Successful crowdfunding entrepreneurs recognize this approach is more
about tapping an existing audience for support rather than building a
new audience for an idea. In the case of OUYA, they appealed to video
game fans, video game professionals, gadget heads, and hacking
enthusiasts. These are all "tribes" with incredible passion for their
interests.

In addition to finding the right tribe to support a crowdfunding round,
a well-structured marketing approach improves the odds of a positive
outcome. Successful crowdfunding marketing often includes these
components:

-   **Video**. An explainer video featuring the people behind the scenes
    goes a long way toward establishing a connection with a tribe.
-   **Idea**. A clear explanation of the idea is required in order for
    the tribe to know whether they have an interest in seeing the idea
    get off the ground.
-   **Motivation**. A clear explanation of why the idea should be funded
    is required for the tribe to become interested in parting with their
    money. Part of this component is building trust that the
    entrepreneur has the ability to carry out his or her vision.
-   **Incentives**. Exclusive incentives encourage the tribe to
    participate. Often these are tiered so top funders receive rare
    rewards, like lunch with the founders or early production models.
-   **Testimonials**. Quotes from sources the tribe will recognize lend
    credibility to the project.

Crowdfunding can be a powerful source of revenue for entrepreneurs who
wish to avoid the more conventional route to financing. With a little
thought and a clear vision of what could be, ideas that would otherwise
be impossible regularly launch into the marketplace.
