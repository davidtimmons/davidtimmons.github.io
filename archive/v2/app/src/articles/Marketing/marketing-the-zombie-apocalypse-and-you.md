Marketing your business after the zombie apocalypse can be a *living
nightmare*.

For one thing, zombies are *terrible* customers. Just try getting that
putrid smell of death off your inventory after these shambling deadbeats
jostle your merchandise. Do you have new socks for sale? Not anymore. No
one wants to buy new socks that smell like the rancid interior of a
broken-down hot dog truck.

You won't be sending unsold merchandise back to the factory, and good
luck complaining to the local police station.

Rule of law is a discarded relic from when people actually cared about
articles titled "10 Email Newsletters That Will Change Your Life". Armed
marauders might as well waltz into your store and steal whatever they
want. Count yourself lucky if they leave you the hot dog socks.

Zombies, marauders, no Internet, and a noticeable decline in personal
hygiene are all very real challenges marketing professionals must
overcome to thrive after *Z-Day*. If you want your business to flourish
in this brave new world, get back to marketing basics.

## Post-Apocalypse Marketing Mix

**Product.** Marketing starts with a product people want. Nobody that
survives the zombie apocalypse has time for novelty vomit when you can
find the real deal inside every abandoned hospital ward in America. But
12-gauge buckshot? There's a winner. Nothing says "hands off my hot dog
socks" like a loaded shotgun.

**Price.** You need to be sure the goods and services you offer cost
less – money, time, and risk make up your cost factor – or create more
value than the goods and services all the other half-starved miscreants
offer. Otherwise, every unshaven vagrant between there and Texas will
toddle right on past your thoughtfully displayed knickknacks of dubious
origin.

**Promotion.** ~~Con~~ Convince fellow survivors to purchase your wares
using clever techniques. An interesting sign with a unique message can
be just as effective as trapping a hungry zombie in your rival's
storeroom. Be creative. People were devising good marketing promotions
well before the walking dead destroyed all global commerce.

**Place.** Sell your goods and services where your customers can find
them. A vacant convenience store can offer protection against the
elements while triggering pleasant memories of the "good old days" among
lonely travelers. Nostalgia sells! Just ignore the bloodthirsty
cannibals that will break your shelves and misplace your restroom keys
because if you can sell one more can of potted meat, you should.

## A Valid Theory

Life after *Z-Day* is tough. Creating an effective marketing mix that
appeals to a diverse group of emotionally dead survivors is hard in any
era.

While your fancy SEO tricks now claim the same global significance as
college degrees and sauna pants, have hope: **Marketing theory is still
important**.

Whenever you pine for easier times filled with social media tweets
describing in excruciating detail the peanut butter sandwich your brand
manager ate for lunch, just remember the "four Ps" is as relevant today
as in the age of habitual bathing.
