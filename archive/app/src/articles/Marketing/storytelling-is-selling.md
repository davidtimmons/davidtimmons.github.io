Such is storytelling.

Storytelling has been around since ancient humans gathered around the
very first campfires. We all love a good story. Some would say it's
coded into our DNA.

## Storytelling and sales

*[The New York Times][3]* says, "In listening to stories we tend to
suspend disbelief in order to be entertained, whereas in evaluating
statistics we generally have an opposite inclination to suspend belief
in order not to be beguiled."

Good stories can stir emotions and incite desire. Using the right mix of
words for your story is critical when your objective is to move a
prospect into making a purchase decision. Look for ways to incorporate
storytelling into your sales presentations and start by injecting these
ideas into a sales framework.

According to *[Entrepreneur][4]* a good sales presentation requires four
components: **rapport**, **need**, **importance**, and **confidence**.

Before anyone will care about the story, your responsibility is to
deeply understand your sales prospect.

-   How is the prospect motivated?
-   What aspects of your product match what your prospect thinks is
    important?
-   Are your materials and preparation polished enough to give you an
    air of credibility?

Storytelling is only effective when it has a sturdy presentation to
support it. With a solid presentation in place, you can then work on
weaving the elements of your story together into a narrative uniquely
customized for your prospect.

## Storytelling components

Here are the ingredients you need for a good story:

-   **Strong beginning.** Have you hooked your prospect in the first few
    sentences? Is your prospect paying attention?
-   **Stakes.** What will be gained or lost?
-   **Metaphors and comparisons.** What is the present reality versus
    what could be?
-   **Repetition.** Do you repeat important elements throughout the
    story so your prospect has them firmly in mind?
-   **Strong, clear ending.** Is your ending the defining point of the
    entire story? Does your call to action encourage a sale?

Build a solid presentation using those principles *Entrepreneur*
suggests. Weave the components of a good story into your presentation.
And practice. Practice until it all flows naturally.

## It matters in the end

Your sale is at stake. Sure, you may be hitting your quotas, but how
close are you to the line? Why would you want to settle for what
everyone else is doing when one more closed deal could be your ticket to
a paycheck big enough to afford a nice car and a much deserved vacation?

Storytelling is your key. You have work to do, and you *can* succeed.
Work those storytelling principles into your sales process then watch as
you close another deal. Your sale is at stake.

How do you use storytelling to aid your presentations?
