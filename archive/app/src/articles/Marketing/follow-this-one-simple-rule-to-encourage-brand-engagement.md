Brand engagement is the Holy Grail of business stakeholders everywhere.
When customers interact with your brand -- shape it, play with it, make
it their own -- within the parameters you allow, brand managers and
marketers have created a compelling experience for their constituent
communities.

But brand engagement doesn't just happen. The word itself can
[mask issues of actual importance][3] and sometimes, even marketers treat
brand engagement as an "I'll know it when I see it" concept. So what does
brand engagement look like?

## Super brand engagement

Imagine if comic book companies DC or Marvel had created the
*[Texts from Super Heroes][4]* Tumblr page. Fans share these images to
their Facebook walls. They talk about these super hero conversations
with friends. In less than a year, the content creators behind
*Texts from Super Heroes* built an audience of thousands that helped
propel this idea onto the front page of Mashable.

That's brand engagement. And that's what can happen when brands people
like create compelling ways for fans to become involved. It makes
business sense to encourage this.

Brand engagement pleases core fans and, at a minimum, puts the brand
front of mind for those most likely to make a purchase.

From a different perspective, DC and Marvel adopt a constructive brand
engagement policy by *allowing* fans Diana McCallum and Andrew Ivimey to
use DC and Marvel characters in good fun. In all likelihood satire law
protects *Texts from Super Heroes*. Nevertheless, a brand that allows
its constituent communities to "own" what they love fosters engagement.

Said again: Brand engagement pleases core fans and, at a minimum, puts
the brand front of mind for those most likely to make a purchase.

## One simple rule

Brand engagement can come from unexpected places. Or it can be the
result of careful planning.

The commonality is brand engagement requires policies focused on
pleasing the end user rather than onerous restrictions that ultimately
limit brand growth.

The best brands, the ones that put their communities at the center of
all decisions, win.

So how do you encourage engagement with *your* brand?
